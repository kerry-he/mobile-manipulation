This is the respository for:

Visibility Maximization Controller for Robotic Manipulation

Requirements:

This work is built of both roboticstoolbox and swift.

You need to use our modified version of robotics toolbox. This has the fetch model as well as some math changes for robotics toolbox.

You can also manually modify your installation of robotics toolbox, following the instructions inside the `robotics_toolbox_changes` folder.



We also reccomend the customized version of swift, which has some fixes for headless mode and compatible with Python 3.6:
